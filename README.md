In an increasingly interconnected world, where individual voices intertwine to form a complex web of thoughts, opinions, and experiences, the need arises for a digital space that allows for genuine and direct expression. This project is a response to that need, an initiative that seeks to redefine the way people share, interact, and connect in the virtual realm, such as X (TWITTER).

The essence of this platform lies in its ability to be a dynamic reflection of contemporary society: a place where ideas flow without barriers, where every user has the opportunity to be heard and actively participate in meaningful conversations. Through this social network, individuals will be able to share their opinions, news, updates, and multimedia content with an immediacy that connects hearts and minds, eliminating physical and cultural distances.

The platform not only seeks to facilitate the rapid exchange of information, but also to foster an environment where authenticity is the cornerstone. In this digital space, each post will be an open window into the user's reality: their deepest thoughts, their most sincere concerns, and their most meaningful moments. In this way, a social network will be created that not only connects people but also builds bridges toward empathy and mutual understanding.

That's why we decided to recreate Twitter, now known as X, as a promising idea that could revitalize its relevance in the digital world, as it has historically been a unique space for real-time interaction, allowing users to follow events, news, and discussions as they unfold.

In this one, we try to present a basic idea of ​​how we could create a small version of this, having a clear focus and objectives from the beginning. To help us carry out the idea, we use several tools that we specify in the **_goal_**.

This project focuses on creating a Twitter/X-inspired social media platform where users can share short messages, links, and images. The goal is to provide a streamlined and interactive communication space, through features such as posts, likes, user interactions, and personalized feeds.

The main objectives include offering a simple user interface that allows users to register, create profiles, and post content of up to 280 characters. Users can follow each other, interact with each other through "Likes," and receive notifications of important activities.

Oriented programming. Classes like , demonstrate **_encapsulation_**, **_inheritance_**, **_abstraction_**, and **_polymorphism_**. A class extended by The platform is designed with object-oriented programming principles. **Classes** like _User_, _Post_, _Notification_, and Feed demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. For example, Post is an abstract **class** extended by ImagePost and VideoPost, while Notification is the basis for types like LikeNotification.

A clear class structure is planned:

 _-Model layer (User, etc.): handles main classes (User, Post, etc.)_

 _-Controller layer: manages actions (e.g., creating posts, editing profiles)_

 _-View layer (view interfaces and layouts): contains user interfaces and layouts_

UML diagrams define the relationships and behaviors between classes. Each class is designed to reflect real-life social interactions: users follow others, create posts, and receive notifications about their participation. The project structure and code are prepared for further development with abstract methods and an organized design.

**GOAL**

With the workshops we want to start *developing* **object-oriented thinking**, learn the characteristics, usage mode and basic notions of **object-oriented analysis and design**, also including covering the topics of **_(UML, models, user stories)_**, thoroughly exploring each of the tools and thus delivering **quality** projects.
